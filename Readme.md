# Token Faucet Smart Contract

## Vision

The **Token Faucet** smart contract facilitates the distribution of tokens to users on the Aptos blockchain. It enables the creation of token faucets where users can request a specified amount of tokens, which are then distributed from the faucet's reserves.

## Features

- **Create Faucet**:

  - Allows owners to set up a faucet with a specified distribution amount of tokens per request.

- **Request Tokens**:
  - Users can request tokens from the faucet.
  - Tokens are transferred from the faucet to the user's account.

## Future Scope

1. **Distribution Limits**:

   - Implement limits on the number of requests per user or time intervals to prevent abuse.

2. **Token Cap**:

   - Set a maximum cap on the total number of tokens that can be distributed by the faucet.

3. **Faucet Management**:

   - Allow faucet owners to update the distribution amount or deactivate the faucet.

4. **User Verification**:

   - Add mechanisms to verify users or require additional steps before token distribution.

5. **Multiple Tokens**:

   - Support for distributing different types of tokens or adjusting the faucet to handle multiple token types.

6. **Token Tracking**:
   - Implement tracking and reporting features to monitor faucet usage and distribution.

The **Token Faucet** contract is designed to simplify the distribution of tokens, making it easier for users to receive and use tokens on the Aptos blockchain while providing a straightforward mechanism for faucet management.
